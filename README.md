# Module 1 Challange

## Description
I scanned through the html, made many changes to make it more semantic.
I scanned through the CSS and made many different changes to the class structures to make it easier to change everything that had the same changes applied to them.
I added many alt tags to the different images to help with the screen reader accessability.
I solved many issues that were happening in the code and make all of the links work correctly.
I learned a lot more about semantic tags, when and where to use them.
I built this project to learn more about semantic structure of HTML and also, how to simplify applying CSS to the page to make the CSS more readable.
